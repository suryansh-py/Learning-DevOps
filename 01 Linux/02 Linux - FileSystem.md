### Linux File System Hierarchy 
~ In Linux everything is represented as a file including a
hardware program, the files are stored in a directory, and every directory contains a file with a tree structure.
That is called File System Hierarchy.

~ Linux uses single rooted, inverted tree-like structure.
~ Root Directory represents with/ (forward slash) It is a top-level directory in Linux.

The base of the Linux directory is the root. This is the starting point of FSH. Every directory arises from the root directory.
It is represented by a forward slash(/).
If someone says to look into the slash directory, they refer to the root directory. 

/root
It is the home directory for the root user (superuser).
Admin user (sudo wala) ke liye hota hai, na ki normal user ke liye.

/bin (User Binaries)
Contains binary executable.
Common Linux commands you need to use in single-user modes are located under this directory.
Commands used by all the users of the system are located here.
Example: ls, cp, mv, rm, cat — ye sab /bin me milega
Binary = executable file (jo run hoti hai)

/sbin (System Binaries)
Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables.
But, the linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system administrator; for system maintenance purpose.
For example: iptables, reboot, fdisk, ifconfig, swapon
# Normal user nahi chala sakta bina sudo ke.

/etc (Editable Text Configuration)
It contains all configuration files of server
It controls the behavior of an operating system or application.
This directory also contains startup and shutdown program scripts that are used to start or stop individual programs.
Jaise: hostname, network config, user account info, cron jobs, services configs
Example: /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts, /etc/ssh/sshd_config

/dev (Device Files)
Sab hardware devices yahaan as files represent hote hain!
It contains hardware device files, Contains device files.
These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
For example: /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmonO 
/dev/sda – hard disk
/dev/tty – terminal
/dev/null – blackhole (jo bhi bhejo, gayab)   

/var (Variable Files)
Jo files frequently change hoti hain, wo yahaan hoti hain.
The variable data files such as log files are located in the /var directory.
File contents that tend to grow are located in this directory.
> This includes
• /var/log: System log files generated by OS and other applications.
• /var/lib: Contains database and packages files.
• /var/mail: Contains Emails.
• /var/tmp: Contains Temporary files needed for reboot.

/mnt (Mount Directory)
This directory is used to mount a file system temporarily.

/media (Removable Media Devices)
The /media directory contains subdirectories where removable media devices inserted into the computer are mounted.

/usr (User Software Resources)
Sab installed apps aur unki files yahaan hoti hain.
The /usr directory contains applications and files used by users, as opposed to applications and files used by the system.  
Subfolders:
/usr/bin → apps like python, node, git
/usr/lib → unki libraries
/usr/share → documentation, icons, man pages

/boot
System jab start hota hai (boot), to yahi se files load hoti hain.
Contains:
vmlinuz (Linux Kernel)
initrd (initial RAM disk)
grub (bootloader)
⚠️ Isme kuch bhi galti se delete kiya = system boot nahi karega!

/opt (Optional Applications)
The opt directory is used for installing the application software from third-party vendors that are not available in the Linux distribution.
Usually, the software code is stored in the opt directory and the binary code is linked to the bin directory so that all users can run that software.

/home (Home Directory)
Jaise Windows me C:\Users\ hota hai, waise hi Linux me sab user ka personal folder yahan hota hai.
Example:
/home/suryansh – mere personal files, downloads, settings
Har user ka apna folder hota hai.
· It contain secondary users home directory.

/tmp (Temporary)
Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users.
Files under this directory are deleted when system is rebooted.

/lib, /lib64
System ke chalne ke liye zaroori libraries yahan hoti hain.
Jaise .dll files in Windows, waise .so (shared objects) files Linux me.

/proc (Process info)
Virtual directory hai — jo RAM me live data dikhata hai.
Example:
/proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo, /proc/[pid]
